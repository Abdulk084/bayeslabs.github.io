Before you dig into details of Recurrent Neural networks, if you are a Beginner I suggest you to read about RNN.

<b>Note</b>: To go through the article, you must have basic knowledge of neural networks and how Pytorch (a deep learning library) works. You can refer the some articles to understand these concepts:

In this post ,I am implementing a RNN model with Pytorch to generate SMILES.

Now in this we will learn
<ul>
<li> Why/what are Recurrent Neural Networks?</li>
<li> Character level RNN model</li>
<li> RNN for Molecules (SMILES) Generation </li>
<li> Generating SMILES using RNN's</li>
</ul>
